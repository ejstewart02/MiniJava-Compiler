# CSC-444-PROJECT

A compiler for a small language, submitted in approximately 4 parts
 - Create a parser for your dialect of Minijava using any parser generator tool or framework. Include evidence of successful parse of all Minijava sample programs as well as at least three examples with your extensions. Demonstrate appropriate user error handling, and (partial) recovery using synchronizing tokens, using test programs with syntax errors.
 - Add symbol resolution and type-checking. Create unit tests and include results for cases of expression and invocation errors, duplicate declarations, overload/override errors, and illegal inheritance.
 - Generate and run code for all of the sample programs.
 - (Optional) Use an optimization framework to add an optimization and regenerate and run sample programs.
